# Demonstrate how to:
# -------------------
# 1) Convert an int to a float
# 2) Convert a float to an int
# 3) Perform division using a float and an int.
# 4) Use two variables to perform a multiplication.
#
# What information is lost during which conversions?

# # 1) Convert an int to a float
# x = 1
# x = float(x)
# print(type(x))

# 2) Convert a float to an int
# y = 1.2
# y = int(y)
# print(y)

# 3) Perform division using a float and an int.
# xy = 5 / 2.5
# print(xy)

# 4) Use two variables to perform a multiplication.

# x = 4 
# y = 2 
# total = x * y 
# print(total)
