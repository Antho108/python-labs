# If a runner runs 10 miles in 30 minutes and 30 seconds,
# What is their average speed in kilometers per hour?
# (Tip: 1 mile = 1.6 km)
# Convert the miles in kilometer 
distancetotal = 10 * 1.6 # total distance = 16 km
# T en 16km = 30 minutes 30 seconds
#  Avgspeed = totaldistance / totaltime
avgspeed = 16000 / (30.5*60) *3.6
