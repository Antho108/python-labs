# The code below works as expected and there are no errors.
# However, the variable names aren't great and don't follow the guidelines.
# Improve the variable names so they follow the PEP-8 guidelines.

# Namename = "Ada"
# lastName = "Lovelace"
# FULLNAME = Name + " " + lastName

# print(FULLNAME)


name = "Ada"
lastname = "Lovelace"
# fullname = name + " " + lastname
fullname = name + lastname
