# Cesar Cypher
# Replicate one of the oldest known encryption in code.

# Apply a Cesar cipher of 7 to the 'secret' variable.

# P.S.: http://www.montypython.net/scripts/dentist.php ;)

# You can start with the following code:

# secret = "I hear the gooseberries are doing well this year, and so are the mangoes."
# cipher = 7


secret = "I hear the gooseberries are doing well this year, and so are the mangoes."

# Decaller les lettres de 7 vers la droite. Quel id√©e ? Sois faire un loop sur les lettres. Sois le truc 
# avec le range. 

for i in secret():
    print(i)
