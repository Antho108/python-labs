PROJECT: Write An Article
Write a technical article about the CLI game you built and publish it on dev.to.

Technical writing is a highly relevant skill for:

Learning: Writing pushes you to practice communicating about code, which helps you to formulate and solve your challenges.
Employment: You start to build your portfolio and prove your interests and experience as a programmer.
Don't worry if your first 20+ articles will be quite basic and maybe even boring. That's okay, you're learning! Remember that 20 boring articles are better than 0 interesting ones. And keep in mind that you can make them fun and interesting, if you want to.

But even if they will be boring. The most important thing is that you start writing and talking about code, and publishing articles on dev.to is a great way to get going. You can read more and get some inspiration by reading blog posts about technical writing.
